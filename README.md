# 8---bit-ALU-using-verilog
The 8 - bit ALU does almost all the arithmetic and logical calculations 
i. e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, right and left shift, rotate left and right, and gate, or gate, xor gate, xnor gate, nand gate, nor gate and comparisions using verilog. 
It gives result, carry bit and zero flag(i.e. whether the o/p is zero or not) in the output.
Used AMD Vivado for the execution of the project.
